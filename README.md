## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project for development on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download and unzip the source code)
    ```sh
    # Replace with the actual repository URL if you have one
    # git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd land
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the necessary project dependencies into the `node_modules` folder.
    ```sh

    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (the port may vary) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run lint`

Lints the project files for code quality and style issues using ESLint.

### `npm run preview`

Runs a local server to preview the production build from the `dist` folder. This is useful for checking the final build before deploying.
